# BAGGING

- **Check out a URL for bagging from the spreadsheet**
- Data comes from S3 Bucket
- Spot check to ensure
- Take folder and create metadata folder for Json template.
- Label the json file and the folder where the json folder where it is located with the entry's UUID (see column ).
- The json should use the following format:

```
{
  "Individual source or seed URL": "http://www.eia.gov/renewable/data.cfm",
  "UUID" : "E30FA3CA-C5CB-41D5-8608-0650D1B6F105",
  "id_agency" : 2,
  "id_subagency": ,
  "id_org":,
  "id_suborg":,
  "Institution facilitating the data capture creation and packaging": "Penn Data Refuge",
  "Date of capture": "2017-01-17",
  "Federal agency data acquired from": "Department of Energy/U.S. Energy Information Administration",
  "Name of resource": "Renewable and Alternative Fuels",
  "File formats contained in package": ".pdf, .zip",
  "Type(s) of content in package": "datasets, codebooks",
  "Free text description of capture process": "Metadata was generated by viewing page and using spreadsheet descriptions where necessary, data was bulk downloaded from the page using wget -r on the seed URL and then bagged.",
  "Name of package creator": "Mallick Hossain and Ben Goldman"
  }
```

- Make sure to save this as a .json file.

- Copy the metadata file into folder where the package is

- Run python command line script which creates the bag

  - [Python script to make a bag (command line)]: https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/bagit-python

    ****

  ```
  bagit.py --contact-name '[your name]' /directory/to/bag
  ```

- You should be left with a 'data' folder (which contains the downloaded content and metadata file) and four separate bagit files

  - bag-info.txt
  - bagit.txt
  - manifest-md5.txt
  - tagmanifest-md5.txt
  - data  (package of stuff)

- Zip this entire collection (data folder and bagit files) and confirm that it is named with the row's UUID

- Put the zip file onto a thumb drive and give to an uploader
