## Seeding and Sorting Overview

The Seeders and Sorters team canvases the resources of a given government agency, identifying important URLs. They sort them by whether their data can be automatically captured by the Internet Archive webcrawler (about which more here and here). URLs judged to be possibly crawlable are "nominated" (equivalently, "seeded") using our Chrome extension or bookmarklet. This sorting is only provisional: when in doubt seeders mark a URL as possibly not crawlable, and these URLs populate a spreadsheet.
The best source of information about the seeding and sorting process is represented at [https://envirodatagov.org/](https://envirodatagov.org/).
