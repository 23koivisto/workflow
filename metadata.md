- In spreadsheet list, locate an item that has been bagged and uploaded and it ready for the CKAN/metadata step

- Claim it by entering your slack name in the Metadata cell

- QA step: Click on URL for the bag in S3 and download it, then unzip it and spot check some of the files

- Create new record in CKan 

- Open the Json file 


- Follow metadata schema spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12JAleU6eF4wgu0hIlQ5efoOUCsZjT-UkRxwAofVZp6c/edit#gid=1879921913)

- Upload the JSON file (from thumbdrive) to CKan

- Click link from the S3 bucket that you have populated in the form that you copied from the spreadsheet.
